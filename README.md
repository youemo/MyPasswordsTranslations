# My Passwords App Translations
### Project to make translations easier

This open source project is meant to host translation files of the [My Passwords](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.er.mo.apps.mypasswords) application for easier exchange and collaboration.
For those who don't use the application in English would be really helpful.
Any feedback, help and new language translations are greatly appreciated.

So basically you fork the project, make the translation to your language and then send a pull request.
I will then take the updated translation files and put them into the main application repository.
